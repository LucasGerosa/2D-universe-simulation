Everyone has seen a picture of the solar system, but they usually don't do a very good job at showing how truly far apart each planet is, and how tiny they look compared to the vast and empty space of our home system.

Also, this simulation shows how the solar system and living beings of a 2D universe would be different to those of our 3D universe. This is intended to illustrate my article (which is not yet complete) on the physics of a 2D universe.

Instructions:
Arrow keys: camera panning.
Plus and minus keys: zooming.
Z: toggles radius to scale.
C: centralizes the screen.
